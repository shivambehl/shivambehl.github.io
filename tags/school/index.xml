      <description>This was my first school and the only school I attended in my home town - Yamuna Nagar.
I attended MVM from Pre Nursery to class 8th.
Fun Fact 1: Before begining of school activities and before leaving for home, we used to meditation in school. School policy, cool huh?! :)
Fun Fact 2: I was part of National Cadit Corps and have NCC &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; Certificate.</description>
